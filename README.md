# Metro-App
The project is about a Metro application which will take information of the source station and the destination station from the user and display the fare and shortest possible route to reach the destination.
Feature 1:
Shortest Possible Distance
Explanation:
If the user selects the option for the shortest possible distance, then the application will
display the shortest route which will take the least amount of time for the user to reach to
its destination.
Feature 2:
Lowest Fare
Explanation:

If the user selects the option for the lowest fare, then the application will display the routes
which have the lowest fares without keeping distance in mind.

I have used priority queues, linked list, graphs and Djisktra's algorithm in this project.
